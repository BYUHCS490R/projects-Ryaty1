    <p>Welcome to my profile page!</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was born and raised in a beautiful country of Cambodia, I have found myself passionate about technology and its potential to improve lives. I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology and I am excited to learn more about this field.</p>
    <p>There are a couple things that I love to do beside technology:</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Gardening</li>
        <li>Hiking</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people call me a chef, but honestly, I'm just someone who enjoys cooking and trying new recipes. Cooking is my love language.
    I love gardening so much that I spend hours after hours just to watch them. Cultivation is a therapeutic experience for me, and I find joy in nurturing plants and watching them grow.
    Hiking allows me to connect with nature and explore the beautiful landscapes around me. It's a great way to clear my mind and stay active.</p>
    <p>Here is one of my favorite quotes:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><q><strong>How you die does not redeem how you lived.</strong></q></p>
        <em>- Howard-John Wesley</em>
