            <p><span class="in">In</span> a quiet fishing village by the sea, there lived a small gray cat named Miko. Every morning, Miko would sit by the docks, watching the fishermen cast their nets and call out to the waves. The townspeople said she brought good luck — whenever Miko appeared, the day’s catch was always bountiful. She wasn’t anyone’s pet, yet everyone shared a little food with her, from the baker’s crumbs to the fisherman’s fresh sardines. Her soft purrs and calm presence became part of the village’s rhythm, like the tide itself.</p>
            <p>One stormy evening, the sea roared louder than ever, and a fisherman’s boat went missing. While the villagers searched the shoreline, Miko darted through the rain and disappeared into the darkness. Hours later, when the storm calmed, she returned soaked but unharmed, leading the fisherman limping behind her. From that day on, Miko was no longer just the village’s lucky cat — she was their guardian. A tiny gray shadow of courage, reminding everyone that even the smallest heart can carry great bravery.</p>
