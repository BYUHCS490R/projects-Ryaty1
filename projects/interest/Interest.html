        <h2>Culinary Art</h2>

        <h2>Gardening</h2>
        <p>Gardening is another one of my passions. I find it incredibly rewarding to nurture plants and watch them grow. It connects me with nature and provides a sense of peace. I love spending time outdoors, getting my hands dirty, and seeing the fruits of my labor blossom.</p>

        <h2>Answers the Questions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The color I chose to emphasize text are red (rgb = 228, 3, 3) for header, and deep royal blue (rgb = 1, 28, 128) for h2 visit.</li>
            <li> I used Light gray for the .footer (rgb = 203, 211, 219)</li>
            <li>I choose the color by checking some other page, and try to find a color scheme that works well together. Also I tried to hilight with different colors on the <span class="italic">"Visit Other Links"</span> to stand it out.</li>
        </ul>
