        <h2>Roselle Hibiscus: Bright Color, Refreshing Taste</h2>
        <img src="hibiscus.png" alt="Roselle hibiscus calyces and tea" class="content-image">

        <p>
          Roselle hibiscus is a plant known for its bright red calyces, which are often dried and used to make tangy, ruby-colored teas and drinks.
          In many warm regions, roselle grows well in home gardens and can be harvested near the end of the growing season.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hibiscus tea made from roselle is naturally caffeine-free and provides small amounts of vitamin C and plant pigments called anthocyanins.
          These pigments give the tea its deep color and are one reason people enjoy hibiscus as part of a colorful diet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Families sometimes serve chilled hibiscus drinks on hot days or warm tea in the evening as a simple way to relax.
          These traditional practices are meant for refreshment and comfort and should not be viewed as a treatment for medical conditions.
        </p>

        <p class="reference-note">
          Information about roselle hibiscus and hibiscus tea comes from agricultural fact sheets and nutrition articles that discuss hibiscus as a flavorful, plant-based drink option.
