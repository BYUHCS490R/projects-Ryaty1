        <p>
          Beans are one of the easiest ways to add plant-based protein and fiber to everyday meals.
          Many communities grow beans in home gardens because they dry well, store for a long time, and can be cooked in many different ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          A serving of cooked beans is naturally low in fat and provides a combination of complex carbohydrates, potassium, and iron.
          The high fiber content can help you feel full longer and may support healthy cholesterol levels when eaten regularly as part of a balanced diet.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many homes, beans are used in soups, stews, and rice dishes, or simply boiled and seasoned with herbs.
          When prepared with onions, garlic, and vegetables, they can become a complete and satisfying meal that is gentle on the budget.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some families also use warm bean dishes as a simple comfort food when someone is feeling tired or recovering from illness, although beans should not replace medical care when it is needed.
        </p>

        <p class="reference-note">
          General nutrition information for cooked beans is summarized from USDA FoodData Central, the Bean Institute, and NutritionFacts.org discussions on beans and health.
