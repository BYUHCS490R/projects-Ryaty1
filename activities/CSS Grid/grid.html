                Please describe the parent-child relationship in HTML and why it becomes essential when using flex and grid.
                <p>In HTML, the parent-child relationship refers to the hierarchical structure where elements (children) are nested within other elements (parents). This relationship is crucial when using CSS Flexbox and Grid because these layout models rely on the parent element to define how its child elements are arranged and displayed. The parent element acts as a container that controls the alignment, spacing, and overall layout of its children, allowing for responsive and flexible designs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.</p>

                What are the two main differences between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?
                <p>Grid is two dimensionals (columns and rows), while Flex is one dimensional (either horizontal or vertical). Flex is more fluid than Grid, allowing elements to expand or contract based on the available space. Grid, is telling the kid the sizs, Flex is asking how big the kid wanna be and the parent will trying to adjust to that.</p>
