    <title>Final Proposal</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Community Nutrition Proposal</h1>
    
    <h2>1. The title and topic of your site.</h2>
    <p>
        The title will be <strong>“Community Nutrition”</strong>. The topic will address nutrition facts about foods, especially vegetables and fruits that can be found in your community or grown in your backyard.
    </p>
    
    <h2>2. A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h2>
    <p>
        Living a healthy life begins with what you eat, and gardening is a passion of mine. This project is an opportunity to gain deeper knowledge about the nutritional qualities of vegetables I often grow at home, and to share this knowledge with others.
    </p>
    
    <h2>3. List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</h2>
    <p>
        - <strong>About Page:</strong> explains the site’s purpose, my story, our goals, the value of healthy living and nutrition, and features a table detailing the protein, fat, and calories in different meats.<br>
        - <strong>Vegetable Pages (4):</strong> Each page focuses on a specific vegetable—Beans, Ginger, Garlic, and Roselle Hibiscus—covering nutritional facts, uses, and herbal remedies.<br>
        - <strong>Sign Up Page:</strong> “Support your community.” Visitors can join as members and purchase community-grown vegetables.
    </p>
    
    <h2>4. What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</h2>
    <p>
        The sign up form will collect: name, date of birth, phone number, address, email, option to receive updates, agreement checkbox, and sign up button.<br>
        The nutritional table will display: meat type, protein (g), fat (g), and calories.
    </p>
    
    <h2>5. How will you collect information/images/content for your site? List at least two of the references you plan on using.</h2>
    <p>
        Content will be referenced from reliable sources including:<br>
        - USDA<br>
        - NutritionFacts.org<br>
        Additional academic and government resources will be cited.
