        <p>Cats occupy a unique place in the tapestry of human life, walking the line between companionship and mystery with effortless poise. To observe a cat is to watch a quiet paradox unfold—a creature wild yet domestic, affectionate yet proud, playful yet contemplative. From the way they stretch in patches of sunlight to the subtle calculations of their gaze, every movement feels deliberate, almost sacred. It’s no wonder ancient civilizations saw divinity in their presence: Egyptian temples immortalized them as guardians of life and death, while poets in every era have turned to them for symbols of independence and grace. A cat can turn an ordinary household into an ecosystem of quiet rituals—the padding of soft paws on tile, the low hum of a purr in the still of the night, the sudden burst of energy that transforms a shadow into prey.</p>
        <p>Cats seem to understand something we do not. Their detachment is not indifference but serenity, an instinctual awareness that existence itself can be enough. When a cat curls up beside you after hours of aloof wandering, it is not submission but trust—a silent acknowledgment that your presence has become part of their chosen universe. Their affection comes not in floods but in moments: a head bump, a slow blink, a silent following from room to room. It teaches us patience, humility, and the art of earning what cannot be demanded.</p>
        <p>In their solitude, cats mirror a human longing for peace and autonomy. They live without apology, asserting boundaries yet offering companionship without words. There’s something profoundly comforting in their rhythm—curling up for naps, chasing after intangible light, grooming themselves with meditative precision. Even their nocturnal nature suggests a life beyond our own patterns; while we sleep, they roam and watch, as if keeping the quiet secrets of the night. To welcome a cat is to share space with something uncontainable—a wanderer who chooses, moment by moment, to return.</p>

        <h2>Answers the Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                What is normal flow in HTML?
                <p>Normal flow is the default way that HTML elements are laid out on a web page. In normal flow, block-level elements (like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) stack vertically, one after the other, while inline elements (like <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) flow horizontally within their containing block.</p>

                What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?
                <p>The float property in CSS is used to position an element to the left or right within its containing element, allowing other content to wrap around it. When an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal document flow, which can cause subsequent elements to behave unexpectedly. To prevent this, you need to clear the float using the clear property, which ensures that elements following a floated element will be positioned below it rather than wrapping around it.</p>

                What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?
                <p>Absolute, fixed, and relative are different positioning schemes in CSS that control how elements are placed on a web page. Relative positioning allows an element to be moved relative to its normal position without affecting the layout of other elements. Absolute positioning removes an element from the normal document flow and positions it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (or the initial containing block if none exists). Fixed positioning also removes an element from the normal flow but positions it relative to the viewport, meaning it stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.</p>
