        <p>2- The root is where your website's files are stored. Path refers to the location of a file or directory in the file system. It including the folders and files with names on it.</p>
        3- Default document is a file that name index.html. We can only have one default document in a folder. It is like a homepage for that folder.</p>
        4- The difference between absolute link and relative link is that absolute link is a full URL that includes the protocol (http or https), domain name, and file path. Relative link is a link that is relative to the current page or directory. We use relative link because it is more flexible, and if we need to change the domain, it require less time to fix the related web pages url that use the same absolute link domain.</p>
        6- The list of 3 rules for relative link are:
            <ol type="A">
                <li>The start over rule is that if the path started with "/", it will start at the root site.</li>
                <li>".." is used to go up one level in the directory structure.</li>
                <li>"/" it is used to go down a one level in the directory structure.</li>
            </ol>
        8- Links do not always need to be inside a NAV tag. The NAV tag should only be used for major navigation blocks, such as site menus or key sections.
